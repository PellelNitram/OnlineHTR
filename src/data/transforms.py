# Add transforms for datasets here.

# Datasets will return dicts with keys x, y, (optionally) t, stroke_nr, label, sample_name.

# Transforms that I need for sure:
# - As input a stack of (x, y, stroke_nr) and as output label.
# - Switch axis to fit axis of what model reads as input.
# - same as above but with t
# - label to alphabet
# - lower text in label
# - same as above but with transforms like differences, differences after equidistance transform, Bezier curves
# - left alone vs lowered label alphabet
# - TODO: What to code as transform vs what to code as transform?
