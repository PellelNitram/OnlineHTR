class OnlineHandwritingDataset:

    # TODO: Should be compatible with PyTorch dataset and/or
    #       HuggingFace Dataset where I prefer the former.
    #
    #       The existing online handwriting datasets tend to be
    #       relatively small so that they easily fit in RAM memory.
    #
    #       Caching them is useful nevertheless.
