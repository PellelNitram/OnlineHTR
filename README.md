A clean PyTorch implementation of ["Fast multi-language LSTM-based online handwriting recognition"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10032-020-00350-4) by Carbune *et al.* (2020) üöÄ‚ö°üî•.<br>

## üìå¬†Introduction

In this repository I provide a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of the paper "Fast multi-language [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)-based online handwriting recognition" by Victor Carbune *et al.* (see paper here: [10.1007/s10032-020-00350-4](http://doi.org/10.1007/s10032-020-00350-4)), hence the name of this repository.

This work is part of my attempt to build a handwriting recognition system for [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp), a fabulous open-source handwriting notetaking software. Most of this aforementioned attempt is captured in the [Xournal++ HTR](https://github.com/PellelNitram/xournalpp_htr) repository where I publish working solutions.

## üöÄ Quickstart

The following explanation sets you up to use both `src/draw_and_predict_sample.py` and `src/draw_and_store_sample.py` to both predict your own handwritten text and to store it.

1. Install the project according to [the installation section](#installation) in this README and activate the corresponding environment.
2. Download the model `....` (see all available models in section ...) and place it in `...`.
3. Invoke the following command from the root of this repository: `python src/draw_and_predict_sample.py TODO`.

If you want to store your own handwriting sample in a CSV file, then execute `python src/draw_and_store_sample.py`.

## Installation

This repository uses a conda environment in which packages are installed using pip.

Follow these steps to install this package:

1. `conda create --prefix <path> python=3.10.11`
2. `conda activate <path>`
3. `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `pip install -e .` (do not forget the dot, `.`)
6. `make test` to confirm that installation was successful

## üèãÔ∏è Training from scratch

- TODO Activate your environment and place training data according to below section
- TODO To train: `python src/train.py` - use `scripts/train ... .sh` instead!

1. Follow installation procedure provided in [Installation](#installation).
2. Download the [IAM-OnDB](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-on-line-handwriting-database) dataset to `{data_dir}/datasets/IAM-OnDB` where `{data_dir}` is defined in the [paths config](configs/paths/default.yaml). This download process is as follows:
   1. Download the following files that are listed on the above stated dataset website: `data/original-xml-part.tar.gz`, `data/writers.xml`, `data/lineStrokes-all.tar.gz`, `data/lineImages-all.tar.gz`, `data/original-xml-all.tar.gz`, `data/forms.txt` & `ascii-all.tar.gz`.
   2. Extract the content of each of those files into the `{data_dir}/datasets/IAM-OnDB/<file_base_name>` folder where `<file_base_name>` denote the basenames of all downloaded files.

## Training data

TODO: explain how to install data; also provide quick video

[IAM On-Line Handwriting Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-on-line-handwriting-database) is used as training and validation data. Register on their website to obtain the dataset for free. Afterwards, place the following folders and files from their dataset in this repository's subfolder `data/datasets/IAM-OnDB`. This is how it should look like:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/datasets/IAM-OnDB
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ascii-all/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forms.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lineImages-all
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lineStrokes-all
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ original-xml-all
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ original-xml-part
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ writers.xml
```

## Available models & model cards

- [x] `featuresRaw_decoderGreedy_...`
  - TODO: describe how it's trained
  - TODO: download here (link to blog article w/ bitly)
  - TODO: replicate this in `scripts/`
